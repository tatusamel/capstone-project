    <p>
      *AI-Powered Message Summarization Feature* The AI-powered message
      summarization feature allows users to read long or complex incoming
      messages in summary form. With this feature, users can quickly and easily
      understand complicated and detailed messages from the other party. The AI
      identifies the main points of the message and provides users with short
      and clear summaries. This enables users to quickly review message content
      without missing important information, leading to more efficient
      communication. *AI-Powered Message Suggestions* AI-powered message
      suggestions analyze incoming messages and provide users with suitable
      response suggestions by understanding the content, topic, and key points
      of the message. Users can use these suggestions directly or customize
      them. This feature saves time by enabling users to respond to messages
      more quickly and effectively. Additionally, the AI continuously learns and
      improves the user experience. Users can see and easily respond to
      suggested replies under incoming messages. This feature streamlines email
      management and makes communication more efficient. *Generate Response
      Feature* With the Generate Response feature, users can compose their
      messages with the help of AI. This feature generates a response based on
      the topic specified by the user and provides suggested messages related to
      the topic. This allows users to receive AI-supported reply suggestions for
      incoming messages, enabling them to respond more quickly and effectively.
      *Timeline Feature* With the Timeline feature, users can view all their
      conversations with the other party on a single screen as an output. This
      makes it easier to track message history. The Timeline feature allows
      users to organize and manage their messages more effectively.
